Command to create Gatsby project:
  npm install -g gatsby-cli (Learnt this in troubleshooting if gatsby-cli is not intalled then 
                              gatsby project won't work.)
  npx gatsby new gatsby-blog

To run Project:
  npm run develop


Local Host --graphql:
  {
    allFiles //and hit Ctrl + Enter to see actual properties
  }

  like this 
    {
	allFile {
	  edges { // arrays of numbers of files we have in our images folder
	    node { // inisde every edge is node, node is representation what that file is
                We can select properties in left pane to select and look at
	      id
	    }
	  }
	}
}

Installing => npm install gatsby-transformer-remark
  The transfomer will allow us take these files from queries
  using allFiles query, transfomer will get data for us that sits
  inisde node files

useful informaiton:
  if we see yarn.lock means our gatsby is installed with yarn packages and we are 
  required to use 
    => yarn add gatsby-transformer-remark
  
  if we see package-lock.json then it means we are required to use 
    => npm install gatsby-transformer-remark
  
  Adding below line in gatsby-config.js
    => `gatsby-transformer-remark`
          ==== Adding it on top of 
            ###### => `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
            ###### => `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    It is plugin that allows us to convert markdown data into html  

  We need below three packages to run style components in gatsby properly
    ==> npm install gatsby-plugin-styled-components
    ==> npm install styled-components
    ==> npm install babel-plugin-styled-components  


    add this line in gatsby-config.js below `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
      ==> `gatsby-plugin-styled-components`,
